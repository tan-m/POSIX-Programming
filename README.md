Producer-Consumer problem:  

In this project, the idea is to have threads execute in different processes and communicate through shared memory.  

There are two parts in this project.
part1 - here a single LINUX process containing four POSIX threads  
part2 - four LINUX processes, one for each of the three producers and one for the consumer  


To run the program, type the following at the shell  
1. make  
2. ./prodcon
